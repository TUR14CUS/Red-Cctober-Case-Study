# Red October Incident Presentation Plan

## General Structure of the Presentation (4 Elements)

---

### 1. Introduction to Cybersecurity Basics (Felix)
- **Objective:** Provide a basic overview of cybersecurity to set the stage before diving into the specific case of **Red October**.
- **Duration:** ~3 minutes

- **Topics to Cover:**
  - **Definition of Cybersecurity:** What is cybersecurity and why is it important in the current context?
  - **Key Cybersecurity Concepts:**
    - **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA).**
    - **Network, System, and Data Security.**
  - **Types of Common Threats and Attacks:** Malware, Phishing, Ransomware, Exploitation of Vulnerabilities, etc.
  - **Security Events and Incidents:**
    - Distinction between **event**, **security incident**, and **vulnerability**.

### 2. Taxonomy of Incidents and Cyber Threats (Rodrigo)
- **Objective:** Explain how to classify security events and incidents, preparing for the understanding of **Red October** in this context.
- **Duration:** ~3 minutes

- **Topics to Cover:**
  - **Cybersecurity Taxonomy:**
    - What is cybersecurity taxonomy and why is it important?
    - **Incident classes:** Examples of incident classes (e.g., Malware, Phishing, Vulnerability Exploitation, Unauthorized Access, etc.).
    - **Types of occurrences:** Incidents of **sabotage**, **espionage**, **fraud**, etc.
  - **The Red October Case:**
    - Identify **Red October** as an espionage-focused attack.
    - Categorize **Red October** within the taxonomy.

### 3. The Red October Incident: Containment, Resolution, and Recovery Measures (Ricardo)
- **Objective:** Detail how containment, resolution, and recovery measures could have been implemented based on the **Red October** incident information.
- **Duration:** ~5 minutes

- **Topics to Cover:**
  - **Containment Measures:**
    - What does it mean to contain a security incident?
    - Suggested measures based on **Red October** characteristics:
      - **Isolation of compromised networks and systems.**
      - **Disconnect affected machines.**
      - **Change credentials and block compromised access.**
  - **Resolution Measures:**
    - What is necessary to resolve a cybersecurity incident?
    - Actions to eliminate malware from the system, such as:
      - **Malware analysis and removal.**
      - **Fixing security flaws (patches, updates).**
      - **Auditing compromised systems to detect other vulnerabilities.**
  - **Recovery Considerations:**
    - **Recovery of systems and data.**
    - **Verifying the integrity of restored data.**
    - **Post-incident monitoring and security validation.**
    - **Continuous improvement of defenses based on the incident.**

### 4. Lessons Learned and Security Analysis (Miguel)
- **Objective:** Present the **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** from the incident and relate them to security principles.
- **Duration:** ~4 minutes

- **Topics to Cover:**
  - **Examples of IOCs in the Red October Case:**
    1. **Suspicious IP addresses:** Identifying IPs used for communication between infected machines and command-and-control servers.
    2. **Malicious file signatures (hashes):** Malicious files used in the attack, whose hashes can be verified to identify the presence of malware.
    3. **C&C (Command and Control) domains:** Domains registered by attackers to control the infected systems (e.g., domains used by malware to send stolen data).
  - **Basic Information Security Principles Violated:**
    - Which security principles were violated in **Red October**:
      1. **Confidentiality:** Espionage compromised the confidentiality of sensitive information.
      2. **Integrity:** Possible alteration of data to cover up malicious activity.
      3. **Availability:** Although the primary goal of Red October was not service disruption, the attack may have impacted availability by compromising systems and networks.

## Conclusion (Rodrigo)
- **Final Summary:** Reinforce the key points discussed about **Red October**, highlighting how the attack is an example of cyber espionage and the lessons that can be learned to improve security.
- **Conclusion of Measures and Lessons:** Reinforce the importance of **prevention** and **continuous monitoring** to prevent similar attacks.
